                    As a <strong>senior software engineer</strong>, I integrated multiple reservations systems with the

                    for sales by own brands, to being a white label platform used for sales for 3rd party resorts and other

                    As a senior developer, I played a leadership role in developing one of the company's flagship products.
                    I was responsible for meeting with product owners, running an agile project management process,
                    architecture, estimating implementation times, ensuring a consistent quality of implementation,
                    deploying the product to production, and implementing the most complicated features. My team's portion
                    of the product consisted of a public facing web portal and an administrative site for internal use.
                    Much of the web portal work centered on building a branding system capable of customizing the site to
                    give it a distinct look for different clients. The project required extensive integration with other
                    sites and systems within the company and with third parties. Security of our users' personal health
                    information was always a top priority and required various encryption technologies, secure web
                    services and protection against SQL Injection and XSS attacks.

                    decision-makers visibility into project status and the overall health of their organization.
                    Websites were created using ASP.NET in VB.NET or C#.  Data was stored in a MS SQL Server database.
                    The data access tier used SQL Stored Procedures.  Many of the web applications were added features
                    for MS Project Web Access and were integrated with the Project database.
